# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report security issues privately via GitHub Security Advisories:

👉 **https://github.com/jacob-balslev/skill-metadata-protocol/security/advisories/new**

Please do **not** open a public issue for security reports.

If you cannot use GitHub Security Advisories, email **jacobbalslev@gmail.com** with the subject line `[security] skill-metadata-protocol — <short description>`.

## Response SLA

| Phase | Target |
|---|---|
| Triage acknowledgement | within 7 calendar days of report |
| Initial assessment | within 14 days |
| Fix or mitigation plan | within 30 days for high-severity issues; 90 days otherwise |

These are targets, not guarantees. Single-maintainer project — please be patient and follow up if you have not heard back.

## Scope

In scope:
- Source code, JSON schemas, and published `@skill-graph/protocol` npm package.
- Documentation in this repository.

Out of scope:
- Skills loaded into third-party agent runtimes.
- Forks of this repo published outside `github.com/jacob-balslev`.
- Vulnerabilities in upstream dependencies — please report to those projects.

## Coordinated Disclosure

We follow coordinated disclosure. Reporters will be credited in the published security advisory once a fix is released, unless the reporter requests anonymity.
