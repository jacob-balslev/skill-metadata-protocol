# Field Rationale — Why These Fields Exist

> Hand-authored "why this field" rationale for the ~10 frontmatter fields whose meaning is non-obvious from the schema description alone. For schema-canonical definitions of every field, see [`field-reference.generated.md`](field-reference.generated.md). For full prose with examples and lint notes, see [`field-reference.md`](field-reference.md).

This doc exists because the schema description tells you *what* a field stores, but not *why the field exists at all*. For most fields (`name`, `version`, `triggers`) the why is obvious. For ~10 others, the rationale is the load-bearing knowledge — and lives outside any auto-generated index.

Each section below has three parts: **Why this field exists**, **Common confusion**, and **Worked example**.

---

## `scope`

### Why this field exists

`scope` is the routing-layer signal that tells consumers (and humans) how transferable a skill is between projects. The three values map to three distinct relationships with the codebase:

- `codebase` — the skill is coupled to specific repo conventions, file paths, or proprietary terminology. Loading it in another repo would mislead the agent.
- `reference` — the skill is pure knowledge with no repo coupling (e.g., `wcag-audit-patterns`, `next-best-practices`). Safe to load anywhere.
- `portable` — the skill captures patterns that transfer between similar repos but may need light adaptation (e.g., `webhook-integration`, `database-migration`).

Without `scope`, a consumer cannot tell at glance whether a skill it inherited from another project is safe to use, or whether it's leaking assumptions from that project. The router uses `scope` together with `workspace_tags` to enforce project-fit — a `codebase` skill from project A is filtered out when serving project B even if the keywords match.

### Common confusion

Authors confuse `scope: portable` with "I haven't bothered to check yet" — using it as the default. The schema accepts that, but the routing decisions downstream are wrong if the skill actually depends on project-specific conventions. Default to `portable` only after a real check that the skill has no hidden repo coupling. When in doubt, use `codebase` and let the consumer relax the constraint explicitly.

### Worked example

```yaml
# Coupled to a specific repo's table names + auth helpers
scope: codebase

# Universal patterns; safe to load in any web project
scope: reference

# Pattern transfers but needs light adaptation
scope: portable
```

## `eval_artifacts`

### Why this field exists

`eval_artifacts` is the disk-truth axis of the eval-health triple: are there actual eval files at `evals/<skill>.json` (or similar)? It exists because three orthogonal questions about eval health needed to be representable separately:

1. **Are eval files on disk?** — `eval_artifacts` (`none` / `planned` / `present`)
2. **What does the eval say?** — `eval_state` (`unverified` / `passing` / `monitored`)
3. **Is routing coverage evaluated?** — `routing_eval` (`absent` / `present`)

Conflating these into a single field hides important information. A skill can have `eval_artifacts: present + eval_state: unverified` (the file exists but has never run); or `eval_artifacts: planned + eval_state: unverified` (no file yet, intent declared). Each combination has a meaningful action — the field must be able to express them all.

### Common confusion

Authors set `eval_artifacts: planned` and never come back. ADR 0005 introduced a staleness guard: if `freshness` is older than `lifecycle.stale_after_days` (default 180) and `eval_artifacts: planned`, lint warns. Plan or move on; don't park forever.

### Worked example

```yaml
eval_artifacts: planned       # Intent declared, no file yet
eval_state: unverified        # Nothing has run
routing_eval: absent          # Routing coverage not part of plan
```

---

## `eval_state`

### Why this field exists

`eval_state` is the runtime-truth axis: when the eval ran, what did it say? Distinct from `eval_artifacts` because a file can exist without ever running, and a file can run repeatedly producing different verdicts. The three values trace the runtime trajectory:

- `unverified` — file exists but no recent run, OR no file
- `passing` — last run was green
- `monitored` — runs on a cadence, currently green

Together with `eval_artifacts`, the two fields capture the eval lifecycle without forcing the author to choose between "is there a file" and "did it pass" — both questions get explicit answers.

### Common confusion

`eval_state: passing` is a strictly weaker claim than `monitored`. `passing` means "I ran it once and it was green at that moment"; `monitored` means "it runs regularly and the latest run is green". If you don't have a cadence, you have `passing`, not `monitored` — the difference matters for consumers deciding how much to trust the skill.

---

## `routing_eval`

### Why this field exists

`routing_eval` was added in v3.x because content-quality evals (which `eval_state` captures) say nothing about whether the router actually picks the skill for the right queries. A skill can have a perfect eval verdict on its content while being completely invisible to the router because its keywords are too generic, or it is being boundary-excluded by another skill, or its `examples[]` overlap with a stronger competitor.

The harness at `scripts/skill-graph-routing-eval.js` makes the `present` claim verifiable: it runs every `examples[]` through `scripts/skill-graph-route.js` and asserts the skill wins; runs every `anti_examples[]` and asserts the winner is NOT this skill. Lint check 12 then gates the assertion — `routing_eval: present` cannot ship unless the harness agrees.

### Common confusion

Authors flip `routing_eval` to `present` because they wrote `examples[]` and feel confident — without ever running the harness. The lint check then refuses the commit. This is intentional: honesty over green checkmarks. Default to `absent`; flip to `present` only when `node scripts/skill-graph-routing-eval.js --skill <name>` exits 0.

### Worked example

```yaml
routing_eval: absent   # Default — be honest until verified

# Once node scripts/skill-graph-routing-eval.js --skill X returns PASS:
routing_eval: present  # Verified, lint check 12 will gate
```

## `relations.depends_on`

### Why this field exists

`depends_on` is the operational-prerequisite predicate. Distinct from `relations.related` (symmetric co-read) and `relations.broader` (cross-skill generalisation), `depends_on` says: "this skill cannot fulfil its claims without the target skill being available". The router treats it as transitive — if A depends on B, and B depends on C, the agent gets all three.

The optional `min_version` constraint exists because skill contracts evolve. A dependency on `api-key-management` 1.0 may be incorrect under 2.0 if the target's API surface changed. Authors pin only when the constraint is real; if any version works, omit `min_version`.

### Common confusion

`depends_on` is for skills the dependent skill needs at *agent runtime* — when the agent loads the dependent, it should also load the dependencies. Conceptual prerequisites that don't need co-loading at runtime belong in `relations.broader` (this skill is a specialisation of …) or in the SKILL.md prose, not in `depends_on`.

### Worked example

```yaml
relations:
  depends_on:
    - skill: api-key-management
      min_version: "1.2.0"        # constraint is real — broke at 2.0
    - testing-strategy            # any version works — bare string
```

## `relations.verify_with`

### Why this field exists

`verify_with` maps to PROV-O `prov:wasInformedBy` — the target skill's claims inform this skill's claims. It's the cross-skill verification predicate. Use when running this skill's checks would benefit from co-loading another skill's verification patterns.

The router co-loads `verify_with` partners as a one-hop expansion (Stage 4) — no transitive closure, because verification chains can balloon.

### Common confusion

`verify_with` is NOT for "this skill is similar to that skill" — that's `relations.related`. And it's NOT for "this skill is a more general skill" — that's `relations.broader`. It's specifically for: when you act on the claims this skill teaches, the target skill's claims help you verify that you did it correctly.

---

## `relations.broader`

### Why this field exists

`broader` exists because cross-skill generalisation was unexpressable before v3.1. `category` captures hierarchy WITHIN a single category tree, not across skill instances. A skill like `react-best-practices` is conceptually a specialisation of `frontend` (a more general standalone skill), but `category` cannot represent that relationship because both skills sit in the engineering category at the same depth.

`broader` adds SKOS-style cross-skill generalisation (skos:broader). The router uses it for parent recall: when the specific skill matches, the parent is co-loaded as a generalisation companion. The inverse (`narrower`) is NOT used to drive co-load — a parent match should not pull in arbitrary children.

### Common confusion

`broader` looks similar to `extends` but differs critically. `extends` is overlay-only and creates an existential dependency — the overlay ceases to have meaning without its parent (ADR 0003). `broader` is informational generalisation; the child is a coherent skill on its own and would survive its parent being deleted. Use `extends` only with `type: overlay`; use `broader` for everything else.

## `grounding.evidence_priority`

### Why this field exists

`grounding.evidence_priority` lets a skill rank evidence when repo files and general knowledge disagree. Without an explicit priority, agents reading the skill have to invent ad-hoc tie-breaking rules, which is unsafe when the skill makes claims about specific code.

Three values are valid in v3: `repo_code_first` (repo evidence wins), `general_knowledge_first` (external standard or general doctrine wins), and `equal` (case-by-case judgment required).

### Common confusion

`repo_code_first` is the right default for skills grounded in a specific repo's code. `general_knowledge_first` is correct only when the skill teaches an external standard and the repo may legitimately lag behind it. Use `equal` when the skill's verification section explains how to resolve conflicts.

---

## `lifecycle.review_cadence`

### Why this field exists

`review_cadence` lets the maintainer declare a review rhythm independent of the calendar `freshness` claim. A skill that is reviewed quarterly is in a different posture than one reviewed annually, even if both have the same `freshness` date. Drift-check workflows can read the cadence and warn when a review is overdue relative to the cadence, not just relative to a fixed staleness threshold.

### Common confusion

`review_cadence` is a process commitment, not a fact about the past. Don't set it to `quarterly` aspirationally if you have no actual cadence; omit it and use `stale_after_days` to drive reviews. Lying in the cadence makes the next maintainer mistrust the whole frontmatter.

---

## `portability.readiness`

### Why this field exists

`portability.readiness` exists because `scope` says where a skill applies, while readiness says how proven its export path is. A skill can be `scope: portable` and still have only a declared portability claim. Authors use `declared` for metadata-only portability, `scripted` when an export transform exists for at least one target, and `verified` when the exported output has been checked with a receipt.

Consumers use `readiness` together with `scope` to decide whether a skill is only theoretically portable, mechanically exportable, or already verified in a target runtime.

### Common confusion

Do not use `readiness` as a second taxonomy for project fit. `scope: portable` plus `portability.readiness: declared` is a valid state: the skill is intended to transfer, but no export verification exists yet. Move to `scripted` only when tooling exists, and to `verified` only when there is a concrete verification receipt.
